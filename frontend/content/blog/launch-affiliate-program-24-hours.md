# How to Launch Your Affiliate Program in 24 Hours

Most companies spend 3-6 months launching an affiliate program. Here's how to do it in 24 hours without losing your mind.

## The Framework

Launching fast doesn't mean launching half-baked. It means being ruthlessly pragmatic about what matters.

### Hour 1-2: Define Your Program

- **Commission structure**: Pick one. Don't overthink it.
- **Partner types**: Who are you targeting? Agencies? Resellers? Content creators?
- **Core benefit**: Why would someone partner with you?

### Hour 3-6: Build Minimum Infrastructure

- Payment tracking (spreadsheet is fine for v1)
- Partner onboarding form (Google Form works)
- Tracking mechanism (UTM parameters or redirect links)
- Communication channel (email list, Slack, Discord)

### Hour 7-20: Launch & Recruit

- Send to 10-20 warm leads
- Get feedback
- Iterate based on early feedback
- Start recruiting your first cohort

### Hour 21-24: Polish & Document

- Document your process
- Create partner guidelines
- Set up communication cadence

## Why This Works

Moving fast forces you to focus on what actually matters. You'll learn more from 10 real partners than from 3 months of planning.

## Key Lessons

- **Done is better than perfect**
- **Partners forgive imperfection if you're responsive**
- **Your first partners are your best advisors**
- **Iterate with real feedback, not assumptions**

Start today. You'll be live by tomorrow.
