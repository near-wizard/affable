# Affiliate Fraud Detection: How AI-Powered Systems Protect Your Program

Affiliate fraud costs e-commerce companies billions annually. But modern AI-powered detection systems are changing the game.

## Common Types of Affiliate Fraud

### Click Fraud
Fake traffic inflating partner metrics. Bots clicking on affiliate links to generate commission.

### Lead Fraud
Low-quality leads that have no purchase intent. The affiliate gets paid, but you get nothing.

### Attribution Fraud
Partners claiming credit for sales they didn't influence. Browser hijacking or cookie stuffing.

### Boiler Room Operations
Coordinated networks of fake partners working together to defraud the system.

## How AI Detection Works

### Behavioral Anomaly Detection
ML models learn normal traffic patterns and flag deviations:
- Unusual click timing patterns
- Impossible conversion sequences
- Geographic inconsistencies
- Device fingerprint clustering

### Network Analysis
Identifying coordinated fraud rings:
- Shared IP addresses across partners
- Similar traffic sources
- Correlated conversion timing

### Conversion Quality Scoring
Predicting which conversions will actually generate value:
- Customer lifetime value prediction
- Churn risk scoring
- Return rate estimation

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with signals, not algorithms**: Track basic metrics before building ML models
2. **Establish baselines**: What's normal for your program?
3. **Set thresholds carefully**: False positives harm partner relationships
4. **Iterate incrementally**: Add detection gradually based on fraud patterns you observe

## The Balance

Fraud detection is about protecting your revenue while maintaining healthy partner relationships.

Too aggressive? You'll kill honest partners.
Too lenient? Fraud will drain your margins.

The best approach is transparent, rule-based detection with human review for edge cases.
