# Affiliate Pricing Models: Which Commission Structure Grows Your Program Fastest

Your commission structure is one of the most critical decisions you'll make for your affiliate program.

Get it wrong and you either hemorrhage money or repel good partners.

## The 7 Models

### 5. Hybrid Commission Model

**Structure**: Base commission + performance bonuses

**Pros:**
- Combines simplicity with incentives

### 6. Performance-Based Bonuses

### 7. Exclusive Partner Agreements

**Pros:**

- Dedicated focus on your product
- Can be game-changing

**Cons:**

- Limited number of partners
- High risk if partner underperforms

**Best for**: High-stakes, strategic partnerships

## How to Choose

### Start with: Hybrid Commission Model
The 5% base + tiered bonuses approach works for most businesses because it:
- Is simple to explain
- Rewards all partners fairly
- Incentivizes growth naturally
- Scales with your business

### Then adapt based on:
- **Your margins**: Can you afford higher commissions?
- **Your competition**: What's the market paying?
- **Your partners**: Are they motivated by income or partnership?
- **Your product**: Is it high-ticket, low-ticket, subscription, etc?

## The Framework

1. **Pick one model** and run it for 3-6 months
2. **Measure**: Track partner satisfaction, cost, and revenue
3. **Iterate**: Adjust based on real data, not assumptions
4. **Communicate**: Be transparent about changes

Your commission structure will evolve as your program scales. Start simple, adjust with data.
