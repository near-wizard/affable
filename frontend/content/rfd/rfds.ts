## What is an RFD?

A Request for Discussion (RFD) is a design document that proposes a new feature, architecture decision, or significant change to Affable. It's inspired by [Oxide's RFD process](https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/).

## Why RFDs?

Building in public means documenting our thinking. RFDs help us:

- Think through problems systematically
- Get feedback early from the community
- Create a historical record of why we made decisions
- Avoid repeating past mistakes

## RFD Lifecycle

### Prediscussion
Early stage idea. Not ready for full discussion yet.

### Ideation
Author is actively working on the RFD. Open for early feedback.

### Discussion
RFD is ready for broader input. This is where the real debate happens.

### Published
Discussion has concluded. RFD represents current thinking but isn't implemented yet.

### Committed
RFD has been implemented or the decision has been made and locked in.

### Abandoned
We decided not to pursue this. Still valuable as documentation of "roads not taken."

## How to Contribute

1. Check existing RFDs to avoid duplicates
2. Open a GitHub Discussion to gauge interest
3. Write your RFD (copy this template)
4. Submit a PR to add it to the RFD list
5. Engage with feedback
6. Update based on discussion

    content: `# RFD 2: Deep Linking Without Next.js Router

## Problem Statement

Our Windows 95-style desktop UI needs deep linking for SEO and shareability, but Next.js router's navigation lifecycle conflicts with our client-side window management state.

## Background

We're building a retro desktop interface where "windows" are React components managed entirely in client-side state. When a user clicks an icon, we want to:

1. Open a window with smooth animations
2. Update the URL for sharing (e.g., \`/about\`)
3. Enable search engines to crawl each "window" as a page
4. NOT trigger full page re-renders

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt 1: Shallow Routing
Used \`router.push(url, { shallow: true })\` but this still triggered component re-renders that reset our window state.

### Attempt 2: router.replace with setTimeout
Tried debouncing the router call but still had race conditions.

### Attempt 3: useRef to prevent re-initialization
Helped but didn't solve the core issue of router-triggered re-renders.

## Proposed Solution

Use \`window.history.replaceState()\` directly instead of Next.js router for client-side navigation.

\`\`\`typescript
const openWindow = (type: string) => {
  setWindows(prev => [...prev, newWindow])
  window.history.replaceState({}, '', \`/\${type}\`)
}
\`\`\`

## Why This Works

- **No framework overhead**: Direct browser API doesn't trigger Next.js lifecycle
- **SEO preserved**: Initial page load still uses Next.js SSR with proper metadata
- **Deep linking works**: URLs are real and shareable
- **State is stable**: No unexpected re-renders

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- Simpler code
- Predictable behavior
- Better performance (no router overhead)

**Cons:**
- Can't use Next.js router features (prefetching, middleware)
- Have to manually manage history state
- Diverges from "Next.js way"

## Decision

Implemented in [commit c505281](https://github.com/near-wizard/affable/commit/c505281ca77974ad680f003ea11ef4501e5bbc3e).

This works perfectly for our use case. We're building an SPA-like experience where the router's features aren't needed. Sometimes the best framework solution is no framework.

## Hypothesis
The Windows 95 desktop UI isn't just aestheticâ€”it's a deliberate filter for our target market in the early stages.

## Target Early Users

### Who we **want**:
- PostHog users (familiar with their retro UI)  
- Technical founders who appreciate nostalgia  
- Developers who value "building in public" transparency  
- People who get excited by unconventional design  

### Who we **don't want** (yet):
- Enterprise buyers expecting "professional" SaaS  
- Non-technical users who need hand-holding  
- People who judge tools by visual polish alone  

---

## The Reasoning
By launching with a polarizing UI, we:

- Self-select for early adopters who value substance over conventional UX  
- Create a memorable brand in a sea of identical SaaS tools  
- Buy time to nail the core product before scaling to mainstream  
- Build a community of people who "get it"  

---

## Risks
- Might alienate potential advocates  
- Could be seen as unprofessional  
- Accessibility concerns (we need to address this)  
- Might paint us into a corner UI-wise  

---

## Open Questions
- When do we know it's time to "professionalize"?  
- How do we balance nostalgia with accessibility?  
- Can we A/B test to validate this hypothesis?  
- What metrics indicate this strategy is working/failing?  

---

## Discussion Needed
I'm putting this out there because it's a bet. Maybe I'm rationalizing a fun design choice with post-hoc product thinking. Or maybe this is actually smart positioning.
