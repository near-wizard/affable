A Request for Discussion (RFD) is a design document that proposes a new feature, architecture decision, or significant change to Affable. It's inspired by Oxide's RFD process.

    content: `# RFD 2: Deep Linking Without Next.js Router

Our Windows 95-style desktop UI needs deep linking for SEO and shareability, but Next.js router's navigation lifecycle conflicts with our client-side window management state.

We use window.history.replaceState() directly for client-side navigation instead.

    content: `# RFD 3: Market Segmentation Through UI Design

The Windows 95 desktop UI isn't just aestheticâ€”it's a deliberate filter for our target market in the early stages.

By launching with a polarizing UI, we self-select for early adopters who value substance over conventional UX.

When building an affiliate tracking platform, the database schema is the foundation that determines system performance, flexibility, and maintainability.

Key design decisions include:
- Campaign versioning for audit trails and compliance
- Multi-touch attribution architecture
- Scalable partner performance tracking
