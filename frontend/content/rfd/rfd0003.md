## Hypothesis
The Windows 95 desktop UI isn't just aestheticâ€”it's a deliberate filter for our target market in the early stages.

---

## Target Early Users

### Who we **want**:
- PostHog users (familiar with their retro UI)  
- Technical founders who appreciate nostalgia  
- Developers who value "building in public" transparency  
- People who get excited by unconventional design  

### Who we **don't want** (yet):
- Enterprise buyers expecting "professional" SaaS  
- Non-technical users who need hand-holding  
- People who judge tools by visual polish alone  

---

## The Reasoning
By launching with a polarizing UI, we:

- Self-select for early adopters who value substance over conventional UX  
- Create a memorable brand in a sea of identical SaaS tools  
- Buy time to nail the core product before scaling to mainstream  
- Build a community of people who "get it"  

---

## Risks
- Might alienate potential advocates  
- Could be seen as unprofessional  
- Accessibility concerns (we need to address this)  
- Might paint us into a corner UI-wise  

---

## Open Questions
- When do we know it's time to "professionalize"?  
- How do we balance nostalgia with accessibility?  
- Can we A/B test to validate this hypothesis?  
- What metrics indicate this strategy is working/failing?

## Discussion Needed
I'm putting this out there because it's a bet. Maybe I'm rationalizing a fun design choice with post-hoc product thinking. Or maybe this is actually smart positioning.
