## Hypothesis

The Windows 95 desktop UI isn't just aesthetic—it's a deliberate filter for our target market in the early stages.

---

## Target Early Users

### Who we **want**:

- PostHog users (familiar with their retro UI)
- Technical founders who appreciate nostalgia
- Developers who value "building in public" transparency
- People who get excited by unconventional design

### Who we **don't want** (yet):

- Enterprise buyers expecting "professional" SaaS
- Non-technical users who need hand-holding
- People who judge tools by visual polish alone

---

## The Reasoning

By launching with a polarizing UI, we:

- Self-select for early adopters who value substance over conventional UX
- Create a memorable brand in a sea of identical SaaS tools
- Buy time to nail the core product before scaling to mainstream
- Build a community of people who "get it"

---

## Risks

- Might alienate potential advocates
- Could be seen as unprofessional
- Accessibility concerns (we need to address this)
- Might paint us into a corner UI-wise

---

## Open Questions

- When do we know it's time to "professionalize"?
- How do we balance nostalgia with accessibility?
- Can we A/B test to validate this hypothesis?
- What metrics indicate this strategy is working/failing?

---

## Discussion Needed

I'm putting this out there because it's a bet. Maybe I'm rationalizing a fun design choice with post-hoc product thinking. Or maybe this is actually smart positioning.

**What do you think?**
