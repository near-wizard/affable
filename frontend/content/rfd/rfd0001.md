# RFD 1: Requests for Discussion

## What is an RFD?

A Request for Discussion (RFD) is a design document that proposes a new feature, architecture decision, or significant change to Affable. It's inspired by [[Oxide's RFD process](https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/)](https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/).

## Why RFDs?

Building in public means documenting our thinking. RFDs help us:

- Think through problems systematically
- Get feedback early from the community
- Create a historical record of why we made decisions
- Avoid repeating past mistakes

## RFD Lifecycle

### Prediscussion
Early stage idea. Not ready for full discussion yet.

### Ideation
Author is actively working on the RFD. Open for early feedback.

### Discussion
RFD is ready for broader input. This is where the real debate happens.

### Published
Discussion has concluded. RFD represents current thinking but isn't implemented yet.

### Committed
RFD has been implemented or the decision has been made and locked in.

### Abandoned
We decided not to pursue this. Still valuable as documentation of "roads not taken."

## How to Contribute

1. Check existing RFDs to avoid duplicates
2. Open a GitHub Discussion to gauge interest
3. Write your RFD (copy this template)
4. Submit a PR to add it to the RFD list
5. Engage with feedback
6. Update based on discussion

Let's build this thing transparently!
