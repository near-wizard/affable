		question: "How quickly can I launch my partner program?",
		answer:
			"You can have a fully functional partner program running in less than 24 hours. Our onboarding process is streamlined for founders who don't have dedicated operations teams. Most setups take 2-4 hours.",
	},
	{
		question: "What are the pricing and payment terms?",
		answer:
			"We offer flexible pricing starting from $25 one-time for beta users up to custom enterprise plans. We charge a combination of monthly fees and a small percentage of GMV (gross merchandise value) tracked through your program. No long-term contracts required.",
	},
	{
		question: "How accurate is the conversion tracking?",
		answer:
			"Our tracking is 99.9% accurate with advanced attribution modeling. We use multiple verification methods including client-side and server-side tracking, webhook validation, and fraud detection algorithms to ensure every conversion is properly credited.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I integrate AffableLink with my existing systems?",
		answer:
			"Yes! AffableLink integrates with PostHog, Stripe, PayPal, and many other platforms. We also provide webhooks and a comprehensive REST API for custom integrations. Our SDK works with any JavaScript-based application.",
	},
	{
		question: "What kind of fraud detection do you have?",
		answer:
			"We employ advanced machine learning algorithms to detect suspicious patterns including impossible conversion velocities, geographic anomalies, device fingerprinting mismatches, and known fraud networks. Our fraud detection reduces false positives by 40%.",
	},
	{
		question: "Do you offer free trials or demos?",
		answer:
			"Yes! We offer a free 14-day trial with full access to all features. No credit card required. We also offer personalized demos for teams interested in enterprise plans. Contact our sales team to schedule.",
